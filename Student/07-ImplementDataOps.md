# Challenge 7: Implement development and operational efficiency through DataOps

[< Previous Challenge](./06-Calculate.md) - **[Home](../README.md)**

## Introduction

Caladan wants the team to build automation around how the pipeline changes can be deployed into production through continous integration and continous delivery. Currently the data processing code is maintained in your repository but the process to deploy in Dev (current enviornment) is manual. You should create an automated Integration pipeline and delivery into a production enviornment (build a new resource group to be considered as production).

## Success Criteria

- The team should be able to successfully build a DataOps pipeline to Integrate code and depoy into prodution platform. There should be an approval gate before deploying into production
